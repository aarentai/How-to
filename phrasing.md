- A decade of unprecedented progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has <ins>demonstrated the potential</ins> for many fields—including
medicine—to benefit from the insights that AI techniques can extract from data.
- We <ins>start by</ins> briefly summarizing a decade of progress in convolutional neural networks.
- The clinical tasks suitable for CV <ins>span</ins> many categories.
- Medical data access <ins>is central to</ins> this field.
- This rapid growth has now <ins>reached the point of</ins> directly impacting patient outcomes.
- Videobased CNNs can <ins>be integrated into</ins> endoscopic procedures.
- Scientists have <ins>taken this field one step further</ins> by building entire medical AI devices designed for monitoring.
- Computer vision in radiology is so pronounced that it has quickly <ins>burgeoned into</ins> its own field of research, growing a corpus of work that extends into all modalities, <ins>with a focus on</ins> Xrays, CT, and MRI.

- Cardiac imaging is increasingly used in <ins>a wide array of</ins> clinical diagnoses and workflows. 
- Then, say we have <ins>a family of</ins> deterministic functions.
- In the biomedical domain, there is <ins>an abundance of</ins> dense, complex data where objects of interest may be challenging to detect or constrained by limits of human knowledge.

- Pathologists <ins>play a key role</ins> in cancer detection and treatment.
- This development, <ins>coupled with</ins> advances in CV has led to research and commercialization activity in AI-driven digital histopathology.
- As medical AI <ins>advances into</ins> the clinic, it will simultaneously <ins>have the power to do great good</ins> for society, and to potentially exacerbate long-standing inequalities and perpetuate errors in medicine.
- <ins>There exists a need for</ins> unsupervised 3D segmentation on complex volumetric data.
- In particular, technologies such as MRI and cryo-EM <ins>have led to greater availability</ins> of 3D voxel data.
- <ins>Our key insight is that</ins> we can utilize a hyperbolic embedding space to learn effective hierarchical representations of voxel regions in 3D images. 
- Our choice of source dataset <ins>is motivated by the abundance of benchmark</ins> datasets in the vision field depicting common objects.
- In the second stage of DARCNN, pseudo-labelling on augmented input <ins>is introduced as</ins> a strong supervisory image-level signal.
- These advances have <ins>given rise to</ins> promising frameworks which can use backpropagation-based function approximators to build generative models.
- These characteristics have <ins>contributed to a quick rise</ins> in their popularity.
- This tutorial <ins>began its life</ins> as a presentation for computer vision reading groups at UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon. 
- <ins>That is</ins>, before our model draws anything, it first randomly samples a digit value.
- <ins>It helps</ins> if the model first decides which character to generate before it assigns a value to any specific pixel.
- <ins>As is common in machine learning</ins>, ...
- It needs to choose <ins>not just</ins> the digit, <ins>but</ins> the angle that the digit is drawn, the stroke width, and also abstract stylistic properties.
- <ins>We are aiming</ins> maximize the probability of each X in the training set under the entire generative process.
- <ins>The intuition behind this framework</ins>, called “maximum likelihood”, ...
- <ins>From here onward</ins>, we will omit θ from f(z; θ) to avoid clutter.
- <ins>This problem only makes sense</ins> if the pile to be created has the same mass as the pile to be moved; therefore <ins>without loss of generality</ins> assume that ...
- Let us do a couple of simple experiments to answer these questions and <ins>shed some light on</ins> comparative usefulness of both techniques.
- Autoencoder <ins>is prone to</ins> overfitting due to high number of parameters.
- It <ins>is constituted by</ins> two main parts: an encoder that maps the input into the code, and a decoder that maps the code to a reconstruction of the input.
- The efficiency <ins>stems from</ins> a solution formula for ϕ that is explicit up to inversion of the Laplace operator.
- The 2D Poisson’s equation <ins>reads as</ins>...
- The fundamental purpose of scientific discourse <ins>is not the mere</ins> presentation of information and thought, <ins>but rather</ins> its actual communication.
- <ins>It does not matter</ins> how pleased an author might be to have converted all the right data into sentences and paragraphs; <ins>it matters only</ins> whether a large majority of the reading audience accurately perceives what the author had in mind.
